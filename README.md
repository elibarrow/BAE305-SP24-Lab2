## Summary of Lab ##
There were multiple goals of this lab, I think the most important goals were to learn how to solder and analyze circuits to further understand KVL and KCL. The work performed in this lab was actually very intriguing and not very boring, it allowed me to stay focused on the bigger picture of the lab and what we were trying to accomplish. The soldering was a fun addition to the lab where we got to do some hands on building rather than just aimlessly taking different measurements. At the end of the lab it was easily seen that our group benefited greatly from the material that was presented, mostly because all of the topics we had only worked with conceptually and not had any hands on experience with.


## Lab Assignment Specific Items ##

### Objective 1: Learn soldering techniques by building a simple circuit on a solder breadboard ###

#### Part 1 - Series Circuit


### Objective 2: Analyze a circuit to verify Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) and Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL), and to apply Thevenin’s and superposition theorems to the analysis of electrical circuits. ###

#### Part 1 - Series Circuit

**Picture Here**

Using the DMM we measured the voltage drop across each resistor along with the current that is present in the circuit.
The results are shown in the table below.

|Type|Measured|
|---|---|
|Voltage Drop|  $R_1$ = 1.2V  |
|Voltage Drop|  $R_2$ = 2.675V  |
|Voltage Drop|  $R_3$= 6.125V  |
|Current|  I = 1.21mA |



#### Part 2 - Parallel Circuit
**Picture Here**    

Using the DMM we measured the voltage ($V_L$) drop across $R_5$ and measured the current ($I_L$) through $R_5$.
The results are shown in the table below

||Measured|
|---|---|
|$V_L$ (Voltage acrros $R_L$ / $R_5$)|  3.565 V  |
|$I_L$ (Current through $R_L$ / $R_5$)|  1.64 mA  |

**Picture Here of Step 5**

Using the DMM we measured the currents $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$ without $R_5$ in the circuit.   
|Current |Measured| Calculated|
|---|---|---|
|$I_1$ (For $R_1$) | 0.50 mA | |
|$I_2$ (For $R_2$) | 0.46 mA | |
|$I_3$ (For $R_3$) | 0.04 mA | |


#### Part 2.2 - KVL

This step begins with $R_5$ still removed from the circuit.   
Using the DMM we measured the voltage drop across all the resistors.


|Voltage |Measured Mag.| Calculated Voltages|
|---|---|---|
|$V_1$ |2.292 V | |
|$V_2$  | 3.026V | |
|$V_3$ | 6.686 V | |
|$V_4$ (same as $V_5$) | 9.70 V | |

**Discussion Question 1: How much power does each resistor dissipate? Each branch? Total power? Is the power in equal to the power out?**


#### Part 2.3 - Thevenin
Thevenin’s Theorem states that all linear circuits, regardless of number of components, can be expressed as a circuit with one equivalent voltage source and one equivalent resistance. 

We then calculated $R_T$, $V_T$, $I_N$, and $I_L$ using the previously measured values for $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$, and $R_4$.
||Calculated|
|---|---|
|$R_T $||
|$V_T$||
|$I_N$||
|$I_L$ ||
